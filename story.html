                <p>You gave him your pencil.  "Pencil" was removed from your inventory.</p>
                <p>"Hehe...thanks Spongebob..." said Squidward.  He walks away towards your front door, seemingly satisfied.</p>

                <p>Creeped out by Squidward, you walk as fast as you can.  However, he appears before you and boarded up the front door.  That's the only way out.</p>
                <p>"On second thought Spongebob...I'm pretty hungry...give me food..." He said.</p>

                <p>"...I wasn't asking...oh well...sponges tastes pretty good too..." said Squidward disappointedly.</p>

                <p>You lied that you had a pencil</p>
                <p>"You know I hate liars Spongebob..." said Squidward.  He approaches closer towards you.</p>

                <p>Squidward eats the Aqua Bread.  You didn't realize there was mold in it until just now.  Squidward became very sick and couldn't move.  You took this chance unboard the front door and run away.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Squidward did not make it.</p>

                <p>Squidward eats the Sundae.  He's back to his usual self.  He unboards the door and goes to work.  You also go to work.</p>
